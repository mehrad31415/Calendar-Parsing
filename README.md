# Calender-Parsing
This was the first project of the Languages \& Compilers course written in Haskell.

We will end up building a parser (and a few so-called “semantic functions”) for files in (a simplified version of) the iCalendar format, a calendar exchange format. See for instance Wikipedia at http: //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar for an informal explanation of the format.
The iCalendar format is used to store and exchange meeting requests, tasks and appointments in a standardized format. The format is supported by a large number of products, including Google Calendar and Apple iCal. The specification of version 2.0 of the iCalendar format is given at http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545 and is quite extensive. In this project, we will implement only a small subset of the features which should be enough to parse simple iCalendar files.
